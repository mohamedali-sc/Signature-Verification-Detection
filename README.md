# Signature-Detection-and-Verification
Detecting whether a person's signature is fake or real by using multistage classification. Predicting if an image of a document contains signatures and the location of them by Implementing Faster RCNN and YOLOv1 from scratch. Evaluated the two models and choose the best one based on the score of the validation set. Predicting to whom this signature is by Making feature extraction by applying HOG algorithm. Trained different classification models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree , XGBoost) using this new features. Used SIFT algorithm to extract keypoints of each image and created the bag of words model from scratch. Evaluated the models and choose the best one based on the score of the validation set. Predicting if the signature is fake or real by Implementing Siamese network from scratch for verification.
